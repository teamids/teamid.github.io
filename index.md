Welcome to TeamID, a clan built from the ground up with dedication, vision, and a commitment to continuous growth. Our members start small, often at low Town Hall levels, but through perseverance and teamwork, they develop into strong, capable players. Over time, many have come and gone — we see this as part of the natural process of refining the clan, selecting those who truly share our vision. Today, we are proud to have around 20 consistent members who embody our values, while others rotate in and out, learning, improving, and contributing as they go.

At TeamID, competitiveness is key. Leadership positions are earned by those who demonstrate skill, dedication, and a strong understanding of strategy. We maintain strict rules to uphold quality and rhythm during Clan Wars, including suspension for those who do not participate fully, ensuring everyone contributes their best. Communication, coordination, and collaboration remain central to our approach, fostering an environment where each member can grow alongside the clan.

We move deliberately, sometimes slower than other clans, but our progress is real and measurable. TeamID is a home for those who want to grow, learn, and achieve together, with fairness and transparency guiding the distribution of Clan War League rewards. Every decision and action is rooted in our shared goal: to become top leaders in the global Clan War League.

Our strength comes from continuous improvement — building a clan that grows stronger together, one war at a time.
